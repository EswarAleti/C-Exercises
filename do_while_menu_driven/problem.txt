Could I get some help with this C program? Some insight on how to add the other assignments into the menu would be great

You must place your functions below main() or in a separate header file (if you know how to do this)

You must prototype your functions

Program Specifications:

You are to write the source code with the following

You are to design a simple menu system using a do-while loop and a switch.

[A] Assignment 3A

[B] Assignment 3B

[Q] Quit

You are to go back to assignment 3A and 3B and bring them into this program. Each assignment will become a separate function. The arrays from the functions need to be created and maintained in main(). This will force you to pass the arrays into your functions.  

You will have at least 4 functions and probably more.
